## Reflection on Git & GitHub

### What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?
I learned how Git tracks changes in code and how GitHub acts like a backup and collaboration space online. It was interesting to see how each commit saves a snapshot of progress.

### What was most confusing or frustrating?
At first, it was a little confusing understanding where to write the Git commands and how to link my local work to GitHub. Also, switching Git users on the same computer was tricky.

### Why do you think developers use Git?
Developers use Git because it helps them manage code efficiently, track progress, and work together without messing up each other’s changes. It keeps everything organized.

### How might this help with larger projects in the future?
For bigger projects, Git makes it easier to find bugs, test different features, and work as a team. I won’t have to worry about losing anything or overwriting someone else’s code.
